## Context

Complete Human Resources Information System (HRIS) developed for Socium, including critical modules for human resources management: document management, payroll, performance evaluation, and a modern recruitment portal.

## My Role

As Senior Software Engineer, I contributed to the development of this complete HRIS platform over a period of 1 year and 11 months, working on the architecture and development of critical modules.

### Main Responsibilities

- **Core HRIS Architecture & Development**: Major contribution to the development of critical HRIS modules
- **Innovation & Modernization**: Design and development of the recruitment portal with decoupled architecture
- **Technical Achievements**: End-to-end architecture and full-stack development

## Modules I Worked On

### Socium Doc
HR document management system enabling centralization, organization and management of human resources-related documents.

### Payroll
Complete payroll management platform with automated calculations, payslip generation and social declarations management.

### Perf
Performance evaluation and tracking module enabling managers and HR to track objectives, evaluate performance and plan career development.

### Recruitment Portal
Modern recruitment portal with decoupled architecture, optimized for SEO and offering a smooth user experience for candidates and recruiters.

## Technologies Used

### Backend
- **NestJS**: Node.js framework for robust and scalable API development
- **Koa.js**: Lightweight framework for specific services and particular use cases
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for data management

Implementation of performant and scalable APIs capable of handling large volumes of data and concurrent users.

### Decoupled Architecture
Development of a decoupled architecture for the recruitment portal, enabling maximum flexibility and clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend.

### Continuous Integration
Implementation of development best practices, continuous integration and automated deployment to ensure code quality.

## Results

Development of a complete and operational HRIS platform with:
- Functional critical modules (Doc, Payroll, Perf)
- Modern recruitment portal with decoupled architecture
- Robust and scalable APIs
- High-performance and intuitive user interfaces
- Comprehensive technical documentation
- Modern and maintainable architecture
